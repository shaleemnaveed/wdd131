    <h1>Fun Facts About Limes</h1>

    <h2>A Citrus Powerhouse</h2>
    <p>
      Limes are packed with vitamin C, which helps boost the immune system and keeps skin healthy. Just one lime can
      provide more than 30% of your daily vitamin C needs, making it a powerful little fruit for overall wellness.
    </p>

    <h2>Not All Limes Are Green</h2>
    <p>
      Although we usually think of limes as green, they actually turn yellow when fully ripe! However, they are often
      harvested early to preserve their tangy flavor and longer shelf life, which is why most of us never see a ripe
      yellow lime.
    </p>

    <h2>From Fruit to Fragrance</h2>
    <p>
      Lime oil is commonly used in perfumes, soaps, and cleaning products. Its fresh, zesty scent makes it a popular
      choice for creating uplifting and energizing aromas.
    </p>

    <h2>Limes in History and Culture</h2>
    <p>
      The nickname “limey” for British sailors originated because they consumed lime juice to prevent scurvy during long
      sea voyages. Beyond that, limes have held symbolic meanings in various cultures, often representing freshness,
      energy, and protection from evil spirits.
    </p>

    <h2>A Culinary Star</h2>
    <p>
      Limes are used in a wide variety of dishes—from Mexican tacos and Thai curries to key lime pie and refreshing
      drinks like limeade. Their tangy juice and zest add brightness and flavor to both sweet and savory recipes.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Popularity</h2>
    <p>
      Today, Mexico is the world’s largest producer of limes, followed by India and China. The fruit continues to play
      an important role in global cuisines and industries, proving that its popularity has only grown over time.
