    <h1>History of Limes</h1>

    <h2>Origins and Early Cultivation</h2>
    <p>
      Limes are believed to have originated in Southeast Asia, particularly in regions that include Indonesia and
      Malaysia. From there, they spread through trade routes to India and the Middle East. Arab traders later introduced
      limes to the Mediterranean around the 10th century, where they became an important part of local agriculture and
      cuisine.
    </p>

    <h2>Spread to Europe and the Americas</h2>
    <p>
      During the Crusades, limes made their way into Europe, where they were valued for both their flavor and medicinal
      properties. Spanish explorers brought lime trees to the Americas in the 16th century, where they flourished in
      tropical and subtropical regions. Today, countries like Mexico, India, and Egypt are among the leading lime
      producers in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Use in Maritime History</h2>
    <p>
      In the 18th century, limes gained particular importance in the British Navy. Sailors were given lime juice to
      prevent scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. This earned British sailors the nickname "limeys," which
      became a lasting historical reference to their use of limes for health at sea.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern Cultivation and Varieties</h2>
    <p>
      Today, limes are grown widely across the globe in warm climates. The two most common types are the Persian lime
      and the Key lime. Each has distinct flavor characteristics, with Persian limes being larger and less acidic, while
      Key limes are smaller and more aromatic. Limes are now used in culinary dishes, beverages, and even cleaning
      products, showcasing their versatility and continued global importance.
